### Hey, my name's Louis ðŸ‘‹

##### About Me
Currently a Software Developer at AGDATA Australia. I am a Problem solver first and foremost, with a proven track record of overcoming challenges of all natures across my previous academic and professional endeavors. This bank of knowledge and experience in problem solving, combined with my insatiable love for learning means that I bring an enthusiastic mentality and honed skill set to any challenge. Understanding that the code I write is merely a tool used to solve a problem, I am adaptable to any language or tech stack, and will always be self-critical, to ensure I can find the most efficient and useful solution that allows me to contribute to the project/team as best I can.

#### Education
Graduated from the CoderAcademy Full-Stack Web Development Bootcamp with a High Distinction.
